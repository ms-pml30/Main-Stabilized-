# Main-Stabilized-
The stabilized version of Main app at MISOS.
That's my best handmade Android app ever!
This app names Main because of it's functionality - there is everything that you need!
There are calendar, e-mail adress line, phone number line, postal adress line, a line for any text you want to enter, time line, 
date line, number line and most needed websites page. And on the 2nd page there is a hint: "When finished, you can do screenshotes, if you need".
For me, it would be the Main app on my phone. Why not, if there you can do EVERYTHING?
